Brief Introduction About Myself

I am Raphael Kariuki Muiruru, a passionate and driven learner with a strong interest in technology, data science, and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring how data and digital tools can be used to create meaningful solutions, improve decision-making, and support innovation across different fields. I am constantly working on improving my technical skills while building a solid foundation in software development and analytical thinking.

This repository represents part of my learning journey as I develop hands-on experience with Git and GitHub. Through this work, I aim to strengthen my collaboration skills, track my progress, and document projects that demonstrate my growth in technology and professional development.
